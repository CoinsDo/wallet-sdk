## Functions

### Create a new wallet
```sh
createdWallet, err := wallet.New()
```

### Import wallet from mnemonic
```sh
mnemonicWallet, err := wallet.NewFromMnemonic(mnemonic)
```
### Import wallet from keystore
```sh
keystoreWallet, err := wallet.NewFromKeystore(keystore, password)
```

### Export keystore
```sh
keystoreString, err := mnemonicWallet.ExportKeyStore(password)
```

### Generate address
```sh
key, path, err := wallet.DerivePrivateKey(coins.CurrencyTrx, int64(i), testnet)
```

### Custom derivation path
```sh
var customPath = `m/44'/195'/0'/0`
key, path, err := wallet.DerivePrivateKeyByPath(coins.CurrencyTrx, customPath, testnet)
```

### Generate address from a private key
```sh
coin, err := coins.GetCoin(coins.CurrencyTrx)
address, err := coin.GenerateAddress(key, testnet)
```

### Generate Bitcoin SegWit address
```sh
coin, err := coins.GetCoin(coins.CurrencyBtc)
address, err := coin.GenerateNestedSegitAddress(key, testnet)
```

### Create transaction
```sh
coin, err := coins.GetCoin(coins.CurrencyTrx)
var trxTransactionparams = coins.TrxTxParams{
    	ToAddress:             address,
		Amount:                 decimal.NewFromFloat(2000),
		FromAddress:            address,
		Fee:                    decimal.NewFromInt(1),
		ContractType:           core.Transaction_Contract_FreezeBalanceV2Contract,
		TronFreezeResourceCode: core.ResourceCode_ENERGY,
		ExpireTime:             time.Now().UnixMilli() + 60*60*1000*10,
		BlockData: Block{
			BlockId:        "000000000277adfabcc24c7b065635f3f125c364238ddcfa58ba59368379097c",
			BlockNumber:    41397754,
			BlockTimeStamp: time.Now().UnixMilli(),
		},

}

createTransaction, err := coin.CreateTransaction(params, testNet)
```

### Sign transaction
```sh
tx, err := coin.SignTx(createTransaction, testNet, key)
```

### Sign a transaction with multiple Bitcoin addresses
```sh
coin, err := coins.GetCoin(coins.CurrencyBtc)
var privateKeys = map[string]types.PrivateKey{}  // [address] privateKey
privateKeys[addr1] = key1
privateKeys[addr2] = key2
if multiSenderSigner, ok := coin.(coins.BitcoinMultiSenderSigner); ok {
    tx, err := multiSenderSigner.SignMultipleSendAddressTx(createTransaction, testNet, privateKeyBytesMap)
} 
```
